1. Project Inheritance:
- Our module can now inherit some of the properties of our parent POM( artifactId, groupId...)
2. Project Aggregation:
- Project Aggregation is similar to Project Inheritance. But instead of specifying the parent POM from the module.
We can have both Inheritance and Aggregation.
